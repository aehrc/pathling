# aircompressor Snappy/LZ4 decompressor buffer content leakage (fixed in 3.4).
# Transitive via Spark 4.0.2 → ORC 2.1.4 → aircompressor 2.0.2.
# Library context: not applicable, user controls all compressed input.
# Server context: $import with parquet format could trigger the vulnerability, but
# exploitation requires authenticated import access, a crafted parquet file with
# malformed Snappy blocks, and useful data in the executor's decompression buffer.
# Leaked data would be raw byte fragments, not coherent records. Risk is low.
# See: https://github.com/aehrc/pathling/issues/2540
