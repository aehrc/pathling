# How to contribute

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Pathling.

You can find out a bit more about Pathling by reading the [README](README.md)
file within this repository.

## Reporting issues

Issues can be used to:

* Report a defect
* Request a new feature or enhancement
* Ask a question

New issues will be automatically populated with a template that highlights the
information that needs to be submitted with an issue that describes a defect. If
the issue is not related to a defect, please just delete the template and
replace it with a detailed description of the problem you are trying to solve.

## Creating a pull request

Please communicate with us (preferably through creation of an issue) before
embarking on any significant work within a pull request. This will prevent
situations where people are working at cross-purposes.

Your branch should be named `issue/[GitHub issue #]`.

## Development dependencies

You will need the following software to build the solution:

* Java 17
* Maven 3+
* Node.js 19.x
* Python 3.7+

To build and install locally, run:

```
mvn clean install
```

To build the Docker image, activate the `docker` profile.

## Versioning and branching

All components of Pathling are versioned together, except for the JavaScript
client library and the JavaScript import library, which are each versioned
independently. All versioning
follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The "public API" of Pathling is defined as:

1. the FHIR API;
2. the public API of the library API;
3. the public API of the Python library;
3. the public API of the R library;
4. the Parquet schema, and;
5. the configuration schema (see
   [Configuration](https://pathling.csiro.au/docs/configuration.html)).

The branching strategy is very simple and is based on
[GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). There are no
long-lived branches, all changes are made via pull requests and will be the
subject of an issue branch that is created from and targeting `main`.

We release frequently, and sometimes we will make use of a short-lived branch to
aggregate more than one PR into a new version.

Maven POM versions on `main` are always release versions. Builds are always
verified to be green within CI before merging to main. Merging to main
automatically triggers publishing of artifacts and deployment of the software to
production environments such as the Pathling website and sandbox instance.

### Coding conventions

This repository uses multiple code formatters:
- Prettier for JavaScript code
- Black for Python code  
- EditorConfig for all other languages

Please use the appropriate formatter to reformat your code before pushing.

Please terminate all line comments with a period.
