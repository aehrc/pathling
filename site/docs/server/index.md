# Server

We have temporarily removed the legacy server implementation from version 8.0.0,
while we work on a new and refocused server.

The new server will be focused upon implementing
the [SQL on FHIR API](https://sql-on-fhir.org/ig/latest/operations.html) and the
[Bulk Data Access API](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/bulk-data/export.html).
