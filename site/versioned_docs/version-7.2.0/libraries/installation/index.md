---

### Python

Prerequisites:

- Python 3.8+ with pip

To install, run this command:

```
pip install pathling  
```

### R

Prerequisites:

- R >= 3.5.0 (tested with 4.3.1)

To install, run these commands:

```r
# Install the `pathling` package.
install.packages('pathling')

# Install the Spark version required by Pathling.
pathling::pathling_install_spark()
```

### Scala

To add the Pathling library to your project, add the following to
your [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) configuration:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "au.csiro.pathling" % "library-runtime" % "[version]"
```

### Java

To add the Pathling library to your project, add the following to
your `pom.xml`:

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>au.csiro.pathling</groupId>
    <artifactId>library-runtime</artifactId>
    <version>[version]</version>
</dependency>
```

### Java Virtual Machine

All variants of the Pathling library require version 17 of a Java Virtual
Machine (JVM) to be installed. We recommend using Azul OpenJDK, you can download
installers for all major operating systems at
the [Azul OpenJDK](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-17-lts#zulu)
website.

Ensure that the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set to the location of the
installation of Java 17.
