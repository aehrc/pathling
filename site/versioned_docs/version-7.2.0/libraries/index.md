# Libraries

Pathling provides a set of libraries that provide assistance with
using [FHIR](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4)
and [terminology services](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/terminology-service.html) from
Apache Spark applications and data science workflows.

The libraries are available for:

- [Python](pathname:///docs/python/pathling.html) (based on [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/index.html))
- [R](pathname:///docs/r/index.html) (based on [sparklyr](https://spark.posit.co/))
- [Scala](pathname:///docs/scala/au/csiro/pathling/index.html)
- [Java](pathname:///docs/java/index.html)

All the different Pathling library implementations allow you to run queries 
locally (which is the default), or connect to a remote Spark cluster for 
processing of large datasets.
