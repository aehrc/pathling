### server

A FHIR R4 analytics server implementing SQL on FHIR and Bulk Data Access.

- [Server](/docs/server.md): A FHIR R4 analytics server implementing SQL on FHIR and Bulk Data Access.
- [Admin UI](/docs/server/admin-ui.md): The admin UI provides a web interface for managing Pathling Server.
- [Authorization](/docs/server/authorization.md): Pathling can perform the role of a resource server within the OpenID Connect framework.
- [Caching](/docs/server/caching.md): Pathling implements ETag-based cache validation, which enables clients to skip processing of queries when the underlying data has not changed.
- [Configuration](/docs/server/configuration.md): Configuration options for the Pathling server.
- [Kubernetes](/docs/server/deployment/kubernetes.md): Instructions for deploying Pathling server on Kubernetes using Helm.
- [Synchronization](/docs/server/deployment/synchronization.md): Keep Pathling in sync with a source FHIR server using scheduled jobs and the $import-pnp operation.
- [Batch](/docs/server/operations/batch.md): The batch operation allows you to perform multiple create, update, and delete operations in a single request.
- [Bulk submit](/docs/server/operations/bulk-submit.md): The bulk submit operation allows external systems to push FHIR data to the server using a staged submission workflow.
- [Create, read, update, and delete](/docs/server/operations/crud.md): Pathling implements the create, read, update, and delete operations from the FHIR REST API.
- [Export](/docs/server/operations/export.md): The export operation allows FHIR data to be exported from the server in bulk using the FHIR Bulk Data Access specification.
- [Import](/docs/server/operations/import.md): The import operation allows FHIR data to be imported into the server from external sources such as S3, HDFS, or local filesystem.
- [Import (ping and pull)](/docs/server/operations/import-pnp.md): The import-pnp operation allows bulk data to be imported via a ping and pull workflow, where the server fetches data from a remote FHIR bulk export endpoint.
- [Search](/docs/server/operations/search.md): Pathling supports FHIRPath-based search, allowing you to retrieve FHIR resources filtered by one or more FHIRPath expressions.
- [Export view](/docs/server/operations/view-export.md): The view export operation executes ViewDefinitions against FHIR data and exports the results to files in NDJSON, CSV, or Parquet format.
- [Run view](/docs/server/operations/view-run.md): The view run operation executes a ViewDefinition against FHIR data and returns tabular results in NDJSON or CSV format.
