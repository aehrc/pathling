# Libraries

Pathling provides a set of libraries that provide assistance with using [FHIR](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4) and [terminology services](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/terminology-service.html) from Apache Spark applications and data science workflows.

The libraries are available for:

* [Python](/docs/python/pathling.html) (based on [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/index.html))
* [R](/docs/r/index.html) (based on [sparklyr](https://spark.posit.co/))
* [Java](/docs/java/index.html)

All the different Pathling library implementations allow you to run queries locally (which is the default), or connect to a remote Spark cluster for processing of large datasets.
