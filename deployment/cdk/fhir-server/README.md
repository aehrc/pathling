## Pathling CDK

This is a CDK construct for deploying Pathling to AWS.

It uses Fargate, ALB and S3, and includes a front-side cache.

Note that this construct currently assumes that the endpoint will be hosted at a
domain name that is managed within a Route 53 hosted zone. This is so that an
ACM certificate can be automatically created for the endpoint.
