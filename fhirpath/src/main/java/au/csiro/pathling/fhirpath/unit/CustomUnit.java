/**
 * Represents a custom unit from a system other than UCUM or calendar durations.
 * <p>
 * Custom units are used when a quantity has a unit from a coding system that is neither UCUM
 * nor the FHIRPath calendar duration system. This allows for representing domain-specific or
 * proprietary units of measure that may not have standard conversions.
 * <p>
 * Unlike {@link UcumUnit} and {@link CalendarDurationUnit}, custom units do not support
 * automatic unit conversion, as their semantics are defined by their respective coding systems
 * and may not have well-defined conversion factors.
 * <p>
 * Example custom units might include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Institution-specific units for lab values</li>
 *   <li>Industry-specific measurement systems</li>
 *   <li>Legacy or proprietary unit codes</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param system the system URI for this custom unit
 * @param code the code within that system
