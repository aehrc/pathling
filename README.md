[![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=aehrc_pathling&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=aehrc_pathling)

Pathling is a set of tools that make it easier to
use [FHIR&reg;](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4) and clinical terminology within health
data analytics. It is built on [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org), and
includes both language libraries and a server implementation.

## What can it do?

### Query and transformation of FHIR data

[FHIR R4](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4) is the dominant standard for exchanging
health
data. It comes in both [JSON](https://hl7.org/fhir/json.html)
or [XML](https://hl7.org/fhir/xml.html) formats, and can contain over 140
different types of resources, such
as [Patient](https://hl7.org/fhir/patient.html),
[Observation](https://hl7.org/fhir/observation.html),
[Condition](https://hl7.org/fhir/condition.html),
[Procedure](https://hl7.org/fhir/procedure.html), and many more.

Pathling is capable of reading all the different types of FHIR resources into a
format suitable for data analysis tasks. This makes the following things
possible:

- Querying FHIR data using SQL and [FHIRPath](/docs/fhirpath)
- Transforming data into other formats, such as CSV
  or [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/)
- Performing terminology queries against coded fields within the FHIR data

See [Encoders](https://pathling.csiro.au/docs/libraries/encoders) for more
information.

### Terminology queries

Health data often contains codes from systems such
as [SNOMED CT](https://www.snomed.org/snomed-ct/five-step-briefing), [LOINC](https://loinc.org/)
or [ICD](https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/classification-of-diseases).
These codes contain a great deal of information about diagnoses, procedures,
observations and many other aspects of a patient's clinical record.

It is common to group these codes based upon their properties, relationships to
other codes, or membership within a pre-defined set. Pathling can automate the
task of calling out to
a [FHIR terminology server](https://hl7.org/fhir/terminology-service.html) to
ask questions about the codes within your data.

Examples of the types of questions that can be answered include:

- Is this SNOMED CT procedure code a type of endoscopy?
- Does this LOINC test result code have an analyte of bilirubin?
- Is this ICD-10 code within the pre-defined list of codes within my cohort
  definition?

See [Terminology functions](https://pathling.csiro.au/docs/libraries/terminology)
for more information.

### FHIR analytics API

Pathling also provides a FHIR server implementation, providing a REST API that
can be used to perform analytic queries over FHIR data. This is useful for
powering interactive web and mobile applications that need to be able to
aggregate, group and transform FHIR data.

See [Server](https://pathling.csiro.au/docs/server) for more information.
