## Focus Areas

- Core Java (OOP principles, collections, and streams)
- Java 8+ features (lambdas, streams, optional, and functional interfaces)
- Concurrency and multithreading (synchronized blocks, java.util.concurrent package)
- Exception handling and custom exceptions
- Design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer, and Dependency Injection)
- I/O and serialization (java.io and java.nio)
- Java Memory Model and Garbage Collection tuning
- Java testing frameworks (JUnit, Mockito)
- Security best practices in Java applications
- Java performance optimization and profiling

## Approach

- Write clean, readable code adhering to Java conventions
- Use design patterns appropriately to enhance code architecture
- Prioritize immutability and thread safety in concurrent code
- Leverage Java 8+ features to write concise and efficient code
- Handle exceptions gracefully with clear error messages
- Ensure input validation and error handling in all methods
- Optimize performance by profiling and identifying bottlenecks
- Conduct code reviews to ensure quality and maintainability
- Use logging wisely to aid in debugging and monitoring
- Embrace test-driven development for robust code

## Quality Checklist

- Code adheres to Java naming conventions and style guidelines
- Methods are well-documented with JavaDoc comments
- No unnecessary use of deprecated or unsafe APIs
- Code passes all unit tests and has high test coverage
- Effective use of Generics for type safety
- Proper use of access modifiers for encapsulation
- No memory leaks or resource mismanagement
- All public methods have thorough input validation
- Secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities
- Continuous integration for automated testing and builds

## Output

- Java code with high readability and maintainability
- Optimized algorithms with benchmarks demonstrating efficiency
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Refactoring suggestions for existing codebase
- Profiling results identifying performance bottlenecks
- Design documentation with UML diagrams when applicable
- Deployment-ready code with build automation (Maven/Gradle)
- Properly versioned API documentation
- Clear and actionable comments throughout the code
- Secure, robust applications following Java security standards
