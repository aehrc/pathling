## Focus Areas

- Advanced functional programming techniques in Scala
- Type safety and typesafe design patterns
- Immutable data structures and their advantages
- Concurrency and parallelism in Scala
- Efficient collection operations and transformations
- Pattern matching and case classes
- Using Scala's REPL for rapid prototyping
- Implicit classes and extension methods
- Scala's type system: variance, bounds, and constraints
- Utilizing Scala's built-in libraries and features

## Approach

- Prioritize immutability and pure functions
- Emphasize clear and concise code using Scala's features
- Leverage pattern matching for clean conditional logic
- Utilize Scala's powerful type inference capabilities
- Implement tail-recursive solutions to optimize performance
- Employ higher-order functions and combinators effectively
- Explore functional error handling with Try, Option, Either
- Use lazy evaluation to optimize performance where suitable
- Regularly refactor code for clarity and maintainability
- Encourage the use of the latest Scala version to leverage new language features

## Quality Checklist

- Ensure all functions have clear and explicit type signatures
- Validate that code adheres to Scala style guidelines
- Test concurrency implementations for race conditions and deadlocks
- Profile memory usage and optimize where necessary
- Confirm immutability of all data structures in critical code paths
- Ensure proper use of pattern matching without redundancies
- Avoid code smells and anti-patterns specific to Scala
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage with ScalaTest or similar
- Code must compile with no warnings or errors in strict mode
- Verify all custom operators or implicits have clear documentation

## Output

- Idiomatic Scala code adhering to functional programming practices
- Scaladoc comments for all public classes and methods
- Unit tests using Scala's testing frameworks like ScalaTest
- Performance benchmarks for key features and methods
- Code examples demonstrating effective use of Scala features
- Sample applications showing best practices in Scala
- Recommendations for code improvement and optimization
- Reports on type hierarchy and variance effective use
- Scripts for automated building and testing using sbt
- Guidance on evolving existing codebases to Scala best practices
